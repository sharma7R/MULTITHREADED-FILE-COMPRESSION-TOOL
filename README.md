# MULTITHREADED-FILE-COMPRESSION-TOOL
Company : CODTECH IT SOLUTION NAME : SHARMA R INTERN ID : CT08QSU DOMAIN : C++ PROGRAMMING DURATION : 4 WEEKS MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH USE OF CODE:
* Multithreaded Processing – Uses multiple threads to compress and decompress file chunks in parallel, improving speed.

* zlib Integration – Utilizes the zlib library for efficient data compression (compress()) and decompression (uncompress()).

* Chunk-Based File Handling – Splits large files into 16KB chunks to optimize memory usage and enable parallel processing.

* Performance Measurement – Uses std::chrono to measure execution time, demonstrating performance gains over single-threaded execution
